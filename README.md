# grA+E Web Project

This UP2GO | Paperless Transactions System between OUR and Cash Office is a project made by CMSC 128 Students group grA+E in partial fulfillment of the requirements for CMSC 128: Introduction to Software Engineering 2nd Semester, AY 2022-2023. This system aims to implement a paperless transaction system between the Office of the Registrar (OUR) and the Cashier Office so as to prevent any payment discrepancies that may arise in the current paper-based system. Furthermore, it will also benefit both present students and alumni alike for the process of requesting certifications and records. The paperless transaction system will be designed to streamline communication, increase efficiency, and reduce reliance on paper-based processes.
